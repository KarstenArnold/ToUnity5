ToUnity5
=======

try to port  some unity  projects to unity 5 .
main goal is to make  them work  fluently on unity 5 importing correctly with no warnings, and using no deprecated and obsolete functions.
When importing the project into unity 5  the console should  be blank.
one rule is also to NOT use compiler  pragmas in code to make a project run in  old and new unity,  all forks are intended to be pure Unity 5 beta + compatible and above because there  will come so much  changes  with  Unity 5 that it makes  not much sense to  add compiler pragmas and code redundantcy  for multible versions of unity makeing the code hard to read in addition
